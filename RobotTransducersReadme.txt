1) Controls motors, Measures differences between dark & light (IR), detects echo from ultrasound, can also sense sounds, pressure, chemicals, temperatures, etc. Limitations depend on the range of its sensors, like humans.

2) Transducers use electrical signals that gathers information about phyiscal quantities and converts it into information that a computer can read.
 
3) The transducer physically connects to the Raspberry Pi through the pins.

4) The pin numbers help us determine what to program in Python. Each pin corresponds to its own function in which Python could easy identify and make use of.
